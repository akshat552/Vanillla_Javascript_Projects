# To-Do List Web App

A minimalistic web-based To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to add, complete, and delete tasks with local storage for data persistence.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akshat552/Vanillla_Javascript_Projects/tree/master/8_Project8_To_Do_List
   ```

2. Open the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 8_Project8_To_Do_List
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

4. Add tasks, mark them as completed by clicking, and delete them by clicking the "X" button.

5. The tasks are saved in local storage, so they persist even after you close the application.
